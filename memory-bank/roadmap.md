# Roadmap — Cric-Lab

High-level features. Detail lives in `tasks/`.

| ID | Feature | Status | Summary |
|----|---------|--------|---------|
| FEAT-001 | Project foundation | Done | Vite React FE + FastAPI BE + MongoDB + storage folders |
| FEAT-002 | Video upload & jobs | Done | Upload bowling video, job status API, processing UI |
| FEAT-003 | Video pipeline | Done | OpenCV extract + metadata |
| FEAT-004 | **Pose estimation** | Done | MediaPipe BlazePose 33-landmark track (measurement engine) |
| FEAT-005 | **Action/release detection** | Done | Throwing side (profile arm wins) + leave-hand release + action phases |
| FEAT-006 | Calibration | Done (basic) | Scale from pose body height or provided reference |
| FEAT-007 | **Biomechanics metrics** | Done | Leave-hand arm speed, joint angles, timing, rotation proxies, scores from ok metrics only |
| FEAT-008 | **Slow-mo overlay video** | Done | SpinLab HUD: grayscale + 2×2 tiles + BFC/FFC/MER/REL/FT timeline |
| FEAT-009 | **Cloudinary hosting** | Done | Upload processed video + PDF; return shareable URLs |
| FEAT-010 | Results dashboard | Done | Cloudinary video + URL, metric cards, score rings, AI sections |
| FEAT-011 | AI agent (Gemma) | Done | Coaching from metrics JSON; catalog-only drill IDs via `gemma3:4b` |
| FEAT-012 | **SpinLab-style PDF** | Done | Event stills + tiles, sequencing, charts, tables, AI notes + drill URLs |
| FEAT-013 | History & compare | Done (basic) | History list + compare delta in agent report |
| FEAT-014 | Ball tracking (Action) | Done | In-air flight lock; headline ball speed when the path leaves the hand |
| FEAT-014b | **Ball flight (stumps)** | Done | Behind-bowler + both wickets; pitch-plane speed/line/length UI |
| FEAT-015 | Coaching memory | Planned | Embeddings via `nomic-embed-text` + semantic search |
| FEAT-016 | Validation | Planned | Radar / ground-truth checks; multi-view for true rotation speed |
| FEAT-017 | Train / drills | Done | Closed YouTube catalog + DrillShelf + `/train` library |

## Change log

- Initial greenfield build under `CricLabMLReview` with working upload → analysis → PDF path
- Replaced Notera Memory Bank with Cric-Lab product context
- **SpinLab-parity rebuild:** switched the measurement engine from ball tracking
  to MediaPipe **pose**; added slow-motion overlay video, **Cloudinary** upload
  (video + PDF URLs), a 6-page SpinLab-style PDF, and robust/honest biomechanics
  metrics. Backend now runs on the **Python 3.12** venv (`backend/.venv312`).
- Fixed pinched hero/logo typography (relaxed letter-spacing + line-height).
- **18 Aug 2026:** Two film modes (Action vs Ball flight). Gemma coaches and
  picks drills from `backend/app/coaching/drills.json` only. Action arm speed is
  leave-hand, not cocking peak. Missing ball speed no longer scores from arm
  speed. FEAT-016 (radar validation) remains Planned — stump speed is pitch-plane,
  not a gun.
